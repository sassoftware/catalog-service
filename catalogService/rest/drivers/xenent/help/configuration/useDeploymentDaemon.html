<b>Use Deployment Daemon</b><br/><br/>
The Deployment Daemon allows for publishing images from the rBuilder to a Xen Enterprise target.<br/><br/>
Without the Deployment Daemon, you will be able to launch images that were already deployed on the target, but you will not be able to deploy new images.<br/>
